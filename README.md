# slice


Bismillaah ( In the name of Allaah )

The chapter about 'slices' in Rust documentaions starts with a challange on writing a program that takes the first word from a string.
This is my attempt at the challange.


To run the program, type './slice' followed by your argument, note that you have to be in the dictionary of the program for it to start.
The dictionary is target/release/ .
