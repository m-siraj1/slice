# slice


Bismillaah ( In the name of Allaah )

The chapter about 'slices' in Rust documentaions starts with a challange on writing a program that takes the first word from a string.
This is my attempt at the challange.


To run the program, compile it first by going to the directory and running:
cargo run

or by using rustc, go to the main directory and write:
rustc src/main.rs

after that, a file named : slice will appear, run it by writing:

./src/main/slice

or slice.exe if you are in Windows [NOT TESTED] !
